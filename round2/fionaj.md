## Problem Statement

In today’s fast-paced digital world, people receive dozens, if not hundreds, of emails daily. Important action items get buried, deadlines are missed, and managing inboxes becomes an overwhelming task. Sometimes, after you read the second email you might have already forgotten what is going on in the first email.

**Students** managing academic correspondence and extracurricular updates.

**Working professionals** who rely heavily on email communication.

**Executives and team leads** managing large volumes of communication.

## References & Inspiration
- Google Inbox was an email service developed by Google to bundle emails on the same topic, highlight key details, and set reminders for key deadlines. This service was retired, as it made people give up access to organizing their own inbox. Thus, our project as an extension aims to solve this issue without taking the power away from the user.
